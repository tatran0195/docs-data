## Description

This method removes Boss or Rib geometry and replaces it with a smooth face.

## Syntax

```psj
Geometry.RemoveRibBoss(crlFaces, dGradiation=1.0, iContinuity=1)
```

Ribbon: <menuselection>Geometry &#187; Remove Rib/Boss</menuselection>

## Inputs

### `crlFaces`

- A _List of Cursor_ specifying the adjacent faces around the Rib or Boss geometry. These faces must be connected to each other.
- This is a required input.

### `dGradiation`

- A _Double_ specifying the gradation value. It defines the rate at which the mesh transitions between high mesh density and low mesh density for the new smooth face. Possible values are greater than or equal to 0.5.
- The default value is 1.0.

### `iContinuity`

- An _Integer_ specifying the connection continuity factor. It defines the rate at which the smooth shape transition between the bound face and the new smooth face. The possible values that _iContinuity_ can take are 0, 1, and 2.
- The default value is 1.

## Return Code

A _String_ of 1 if success, or 0 if fail.

## Sample Code

```psj
Geometry.Part.Cube(ilAxialNodes=[11, 11, 11])

Geometry.Edge.Line(dllPoints=[[0.01, 0.01, 0.005], [0, 0.01, 0.005]], crlFaces=[Face(22)])

Geometry.Part.Cylinder(dlOrigin=[0.005, 0.01, 0.005], dTopRadius=0.002, dBottomRadius=0.002,
    dHeight=0.003)

Assemble.BooleanEx([Part(1, 2)])

Geometry.RemoveRibBoss(crlFaces=[Face(35, 37)])
```
